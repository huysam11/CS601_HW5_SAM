<h1>Fetch and Display Data Example</h1>
This is a simple JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and display it in an HTML table. The code includes a click event listener that triggers the data fetching process, and the fetched data is processed and displayed dynamically in the HTML.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Open the HTML file in a web browser.

Click anywhere on the page to initiate the fetch request and display the data in the table.
</ol>
Code Explanation
The code uses the Fetch API to make a GET request to a JSON API endpoint. When the data is successfully fetched, it is processed and displayed in an HTML table. The code also handles errors during the fetch operation.

Requirements
