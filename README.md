<h1>Fetch and Display Data Example</h1>
This is a simple JavaScript code snippet that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API and display it in an HTML table. The code includes a click event listener that triggers the data fetching process, and the fetched data is processed and displayed dynamically in the HTML.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git </li>
 <li>Open the HTML file in a web browser. </li>

 <li>Click anywhere on the page to initiate the fetch request and display the data in the table. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Code Explanation</h2>
The code uses the Fetch API to make a GET request to a JSON API endpoint. When the data is successfully fetched, it is processed and displayed in an HTML table. The code also handles errors during the fetch operation.
